# myAutoAI

A simple artificial intelligence chatbot using Tensorflow

like a version of my chatbot but it matches with ai instead.

this includes:
+ messy code
+ annoying gitignored models
+ really bad intents
+ a random argument parser I made
+ some gitignored venv

todo:
- [ ] more intents
- [X] made it
